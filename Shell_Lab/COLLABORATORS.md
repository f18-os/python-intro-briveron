Francisco Antunez, Alexis Reyes, Adrian Orquiz, Sebastian Nunez, and Miguel Nunez
have helped me with this lab due to
my inexperience with python and the confusion that came with the assignment.
I was lost with what was really being asked for the lab and was looking for
someone to shed some light on this lab. Francisco helped me with the statements
that would let me do my individual task such as when to pipe and when to Redirect
The others helped me error check simple mistakes and errors i didn't noticed conflicted
with my code.
